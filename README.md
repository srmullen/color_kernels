Color Systems
-------------
RGB - Additive Model: Adding the colors together makes for a brighter color.
CMYK - Subtractive Model: Adding the colors together makes a darker color.

CMYK refers to the four ink plates used in some types of printing.
K in CMYK is black and stands for 'key' because it is used to add detail to a print.

PNG is RGB format.
GIF is RGB format.
JPEG is a digital photo compression format.

How does a jpeg store the pixels? How about a png? And other files? I think they probably all use rgb. Even svg files which don't have pixels use hex colors, which is an RGB format. This make sense. The pixels of a computer screens are composed of tiny red, green, and blue lights. Take a magnifying glass to whatever device you're reading this essay on and you'll probably see them. (Should I mention the eye's cone cells?)

This is not the only way color can be represented. It works well for systems creating color with light sources, but this doesn't work for other mediums. Consider painting your new picket fence. You wouldn't mix a red, green, and blue paint together and expect it to be white. The HOA will be knocking at your door. This illustrates the difference between additive and subtractive color models.

Consider the printer. It does not have pixels. The world (as far as I know) isn't made up of pixels. The world of RGB doesn't work so well when we put it to paper. RGB is not the color scheme used by a printer. Printers will typically use a CMYK color scheme. This stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key. In certain types of printing the key plate adds the detail. Or so the Wikipedia tells me. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model

The other model I will cover is HSV, which isn't directly related to any phyisical creation of color, but about being intuitive to the way we percieve color.
